📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Workflow
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics lifecycle, starting from loading raw data in Python to building a final interactive Power BI dashboard and report.
The goal is to showcase practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL operations, dashboard design, and storytelling—similar to real business analytics workflows.

📁 Dataset

Source: (Add your source or mention “public dataset”)

Format: CSV

Rows/Columns: (Add details)

Description:
The dataset contains information related to customer details, transactions, performance, or other business metrics.
It is used to identify trends, patterns, and insights to support decision-making.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions)

Power BI for dashboard building

Gamma App for final report creation

GitHub for version control and showcasing the project

🚀 Project Steps
1. Load Dataset in Python

Imported the dataset using Pandas

Displayed summary statistics

Checked data types and initial structure

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified missing values

Explored distributions, correlations, and trends

Visualized insights using charts

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values (imputation/removal)

Removed duplicates

Standardized column names

Corrected data formats

Filtered irrelevant records

4. SQL Queries (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Performed complex SQL queries such as:

Filtering and grouping

JOIN operations

Calculating KPIs (avg, sum, count, etc.)

Customer segmentation

Finding above/below-average spenders

Creating views for Power BI

5. Power BI Dashboard

Created an interactive dashboard including:

KPI Cards

Trend & Time-Series Charts

Category/Region/Customer Level Analysis

Filters & Slicers

Drill-through pages
This dashboard helps stakeholders quickly understand performance and make decisions.

6. Final Report (Gamma App)

Summarized key insights

Highlighted business impact

Included visual explanations

Shared recommendations for stakeholders
